# EmissionsPlanner

Emission Planner was born in the upstairs of the BCIT Burnaby Campus library.
Spring was warming up and the team had been driving around in their cars with
the windows down to get some of that beautiful Vancouver sun. Over the long
rainy winter and early spring, everyone forgot about the big problem with
driving with their windows down and that is the smell and breathing in of
vehicle emission.

The team decided that there needed to be a way to track how much emissions each
car is giving off per trip and to provide alternate transportation methods to
lower the amount of CO2 emissions on our roads.
